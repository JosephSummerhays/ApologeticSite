      FAQ: Why is the definition of marriage such a big deal?
    </h1>
    <p class="answer">
      Marriage is an institution that defines all of us as we relate to the common goal of raising a young generation
      prepared to keep our nation strong. Whether married or single, each of us has a relationship to that common
      societal goal. In order to protect children and the homes that nurture them, it is essential that we be able
      to define ideas, behaviors, and relationships that either support or threaten the family. For this reason society
      has always identified such things as children, parents, heirs, siblings, and monogamy, as well as adultery, abuse,
      “home-wreckers,” incest, and the like. Each of these identifications starts with a clear definition of marriage.
      For their own self-preservation, societies have defined marriage as the union of a man and a woman whose marital
      privileges are based upon their commitment to protect and nurture the children that may be created as a result of
      their union. This natural union recognizes that men and women are complementary, that reproduction depends upon
      their biological differences, and that the children born to them need both a father and a mother.

      FAQ: Why does the government regulate marriage and family?
    </h1>
    <p class="answer">
      Marriage protects those made vulnerable by the procreative act. This unique contract protects children who have no power to consent to their own creation and who require decades of sustained nurture and protection to thrive. Since the first objective of any society is to survive and to perpetuate itself, the government has an interest in the stability of the homes where children are raised.
      There is no reason to have a government registry of relationships except in that “society needs babies, children need mothers and fathers; marriage is a word for the way we join men and women together to make the future happen.” –Maggie Gallagher.

    <h1 class="question">
      FAQ: How can marriage be about children, when not all marriages have children?
    </h1>
    <p class="answer">
      Not all couples have children, but all children have parents. In ensure a nation’s future, we must look at marriage from the child’s point of view. Adults can meet their own needs and require no assistance from the government to achieve successful and loving relationships. But even aged or infertile couples contribute to society by following the marital norms of sexual exclusivity and permanence, practices that prevent out-of-wedlock births and the creation of fatherless children. Simply stated, if married men are faithful to their infertile wives, they will not be going around creating children out of wedlock.

    <h1 class="question">
      FAQ: Why not leave marriage up to religions?
    </h1>
    <p class="answer">
      In our nation, religion does not have the power to demand child support payments, negotiate and enforce custody, or punish those who abuse spouse or offspring. Since abuse and abandonment are inherently irreligious acts, offenders will likely have already left the jurisdiction of church discipline. By retiring its interest in marriage, government will have declared such destructive behavior irrelevant. Thus those made vulnerable by the procreative act–children–would be abandoned and abused without legal recourse.

    <h1 class="question">
      FAQ: Shouldn’t religion stay out of politics?
    </h1>
    <p class="answer">
      Would you say that to Reverend Martin Luther King? Most movements to improve law were led by religious leaders, including the abolition of slavery, child labor laws, and the civil rights movements. Our government was also founded on moral and religious principles.
